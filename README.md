## Projects

#### Final semester Major Project (Undergraduate thesis)
- **_Human Arm Motion Capture Using IMU Sensors_**
  - Motivation: To develop a computationally cheaper alternative to computer vision based human body motion tracking technology, by utilising IMU sensors. Develop something which can also be used as a means to further advancements in prosthesis control and human-computer interaction.
  - Methodology:
    - Place IMU sensors (accelerometer + gyroscope + magnetometers) on each segment of the human arm (upper arm, forearm & hand). 
    - Develop necessary mounts and embedded electronics to place and interface sensors on the arm.
    - Use a quaternion based sensor fusion technique to estimate orientation of each segment individually. Rotate each segmentâ€™s quaternion using the rotation quaternion calculated for the previous segment. (Rotation quaternion calculated from upper arm sensor data used to reposition coordinate system of forearm)
    - Develop embedded firmware for Arm cortex-m4 based device for sensor interface and communication. Develop a python based 3D render of the human arm for visualization.
